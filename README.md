# App Name
Mag.Net

## Getting Started

We created an application that would allow users to drag magnets to spell words and messages, and then save those words and messages in the browser so that they revisit them later.

1. Clone the github repo at https://github.com/Kevinrosales/fridge-magnets
2. Open the index.html file in your browser of choice.

##  Problem Domain

We used the HTML5 Drag and drop API for the drag and drop functionality.  We stored objects in an array which contained the name and coordinate data.  We utilized local storage to set the objects and allow for persistence and we created personlaliezd themes such as background images to enchance user experience.

### Prerequisites

You just need a browser, such as:

```
Firefox
Chrome
Safari
```
